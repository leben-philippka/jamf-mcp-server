A comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants to interact with Jamf Pro for complete Apple device management. Works with Claude Desktop, Cody, and now **ChatGPT** (via MCP Connectors).

![Tests](https://github.com/dbankscard/jamf-mcp-server/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

**Jamf Pro MCP Server** bridges the gap between AI assistants and enterprise Apple device management. Built on the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), this server transforms complex Jamf Pro operations into natural language conversations, enabling IT administrators to manage thousands of devices through simple queries.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an open standard that allows AI assistants to securely connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that lets AI models like Claude and ChatGPT interact with your enterprise systems through a standardized interface.

### Why This Project?

Managing Apple devices at scale is complex. Jamf Pro administrators typically juggle multiple tasks:
- Searching through device inventories across departments
- Deploying policies and configuration profiles to specific device groups
- Troubleshooting compliance issues and tracking outdated devices
- Generating reports for security audits
- Running scripts and executing MDM commands

This server eliminates the complexity by letting you accomplish these tasks through natural conversation with AI assistants. Instead of navigating web interfaces, writing scripts, or memorizing API endpoints, you can simply ask: *"Find all MacBooks that haven't checked in for 30 days"* or *"Deploy the WiFi profile to the marketing team's iPads"*.

### Key Capabilities

## API Requirements

This server requires:
- Jamf Pro version 10.35.0 or later
- API user with appropriate permissions
- Network access to your Jamf Pro instance

### Recommended API Permissions

For full functionality:
- Read access to computers, policies, scripts, configuration profiles, packages, mobile devices
- Update access for inventory updates
- Execute access for policies and scripts

For read-only mode:
- Read access to all resources only

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### For Production Use
- Implement proper OAuth2 authentication (ChatGPT integration)
- Deploy to a secure cloud environment
- Use HTTPS with valid certificates
- Enable rate limiting and access controls
- Use read-only Jamf API credentials where possible
- Store credentials securely (use environment variables)
- Regularly rotate API credentials
- Monitor API usage for anomalies
- Implement IP allowlisting in Jamf Pro if possible

⚠️ **Note**: The ChatGPT POC uses development authentication for testing. For production use, implement proper security measures.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your API credentials
- Ensure the API user has the required permissions
- Check network connectivity to Jamf Pro

### Tool Execution Failures
- Verify device IDs are correct
- Ensure policies/scripts exist in Jamf Pro
- Check that devices are online and managed

### Performance
- Large inventory requests may take time
- Use search filters to limit results
- Consider implementing pagination for large datasets

### ChatGPT Connection Issues
- Ensure your tunnel is running (Cloudflare/ngrok)
- Verify the MCP connector URL in ChatGPT settings
- Check server logs for connection errors
